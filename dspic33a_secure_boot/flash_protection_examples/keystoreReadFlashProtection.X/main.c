    Main application

    This example attempts to read an instruction from the keystore flash area. 
    Although the keystore flash region has reads enabled, IRT sections are 
    unreadable from non-IRT sections, therefore the read attempt should be 
    blocked. 
 
    If the FIRT (IRT enabled) and IRT DONE bits are set in the bootloader, then 
    the read attempt will trigger a CPU X Data Bus Error Trap.
