## Secure Boot and Secure Firmware Upgrade over CAN-FD for dsPIC33C DSCs Demo - Precompiled Hex Files

## Introduction
This folder contains precompiled .hex files for the demo bootloader and application project associated with this project.  This demo uses the TA100 and associated code library which require an NDA to get access to the complete source code.  Those interested in testing the demo before going through the NDA process can use these hex files to run through the demo without needing access to the source files.

**NOTE** - Only the bootloader project has code that requires an NDA.  The application .hex file can be compiled as is and is provided out of convenience.

## Programming the Bootloader from the Precompiled .hex File
TBD

## Loading and Running the Application
Use the README.md file in the top-level folder of the demo for the full instructions of the how to load the application using the bootloader.  When prompted to load a .hex file, load the application file located here.
