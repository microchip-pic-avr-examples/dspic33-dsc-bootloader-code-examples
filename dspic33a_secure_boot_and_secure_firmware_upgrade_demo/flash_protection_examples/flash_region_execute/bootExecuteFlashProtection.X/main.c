/*
    Main application

    This demo attempts to execute/jump to an area of boot IRT flash memory from 
    a non-IRT region. Although the boot flash region has execution enabled, IRT 
    sections cannot be executed/jumped to from non-IRT sections, therefore the 
    execution should be prevented. 
  
    Given the FIRT (IRT Enable) and IRT DONE bits are set in the bootloader, 
    the execution attempt will trigger a CPU Instruction Data Bus Error Trap.
